# IMPACT-OF-CARBON-DIOXIDE-EMISSION-ON-THE-ENVIRONMENT

## Problem Statement
Since 2000, the global atmospheric carbon dioxide emission has grown by 12%.
Countries all throughout the world have increased their gas emissions over time. It is commonly understood that the world must reduce emissions as quickly as possible to avoid the worst effects of climate change. However, how this responsibility is distributed across regions and countries has long been a point of contention in international forums (Paris Agreement, 2015).

The study's purpose is to figure out which countries have the world's highest carbon emissions. The  findings will be used to identify major sources of carbon dioxide emissions. The findings will help to raise knowledge about different climate change mitigation strategies.

## Research Context
Human activities have increased CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere by around 50% since the beginning of the industrial period (1750). This is significantly greater than what would have occurred organically during a 20,000-year span (from the Last Glacial Maximum to 1750, from 185 ppm to 278 ppm). The severity of harmful human-induced climate change is determined not only by the extent of the change, but also by its irreversibility potential. The removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide reduces radiative forcing once emissions stop, but this is more than offset by slower heat loss to the ocean, thus atmospheric temperatures do not drop considerably until at least 1,000 years.

## Objectives
### General Objective
To identify major sources of carbon dioxide emissions to help relevant authorities in better decision making about the environment.
### Specific Objective
To analyze the trend of greenhouse gas emissions over the years
To determine the countries with the highest carbon dioxide emission in an effort to reduce the emission.
To evaluate the correlation among different carbon dioxide emitters.
